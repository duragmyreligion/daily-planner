# daily-planner


## Description

The reason behind creating this project was to build a daily planner for work that can schedule tasks throughout the day.

This project was built to help out those who are busy at work who need a quick way to schedule their busy days.

I learned a lot about 'Third-party APIs' during the creation of thisn project. Finding all the different ways to use the different APIs was a challenge at first but it did make creating the website a lot easier than using traditional methods.

## Usage

Below is a description of how to use this website.
